"""
Using comprehension write a program that finds all the amount of all items in a bunker and their average quantity. On
the first line you will be given all the categories of items in the bunker, then you will be given a number (n). On the
next "n" lines you will be given items in the following format:
"{category} - {item_name} - quantity:{item_quantity};quality:{item_quality}".
Store that information, you will need it later. After you received all the inputs, print the total amount of items
(sum the quantities) in the format: "Count of items: {count}". After that print the average quality of all items in
the format: "Average quality: {quality - formatted to the second digit}". Finally, print all of the categories with the
items on separate lines in it in the format: "{category} -> {item1}, {item2}â€¦"
